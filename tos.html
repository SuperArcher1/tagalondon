        </ul>
       <p><strongs>Legal Obligations.</strongs>We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
       <p><Strongs>Vital Interests.</Strongs>We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
       <p><strongs>

You can <a href="#">withdraw your consent at any time</a>.</p>
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li> 
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>   
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>   
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>

            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li> 
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

        <h3 id="9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

        <!-- Indention Ends -->
        <p>All other individuals are defined as "non-residents."</p>
        <p>If this definition of "resident" applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>Your rights with respect to your personal data</strong></p>
        <p><u>Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete</u></p>
        <p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.</p>
        <p><u>Right to be informed — Request to know</u></p>
        <p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>

        <p>In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.</p>

        <p><u>Verification process</u></p>
        <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
        <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
        <p><u>Other privacy rights</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</li>
